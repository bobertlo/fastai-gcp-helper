This is my small collection of scripts to manage my fastai instance on GCP. The
scripts are fairly self-evident, just edit `config` to suit your purposes or you
will end up with a P4 node in Iowa, US.

This could be done in a fancier way, but this is enough to conveniently create,
start, stop, and login (with jupyter forwarding.)
